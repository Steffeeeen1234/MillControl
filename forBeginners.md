For Arduino beginners I would recommend the following to get started with all of this:

1. If you are setisfied with the project, go ahead and buy all the required hardware components (see list [here](HardwareRequirements.md))
   - the breadbord and the LEDs will be really good to start with. Those are easy componets which will help you to lern a bit more about the arduino and get some first hands.
2. learn how the breadboard works. You will need a basic understanding.
   - google for: breadboard arduino function
   - you will find some youtube videos and articles which explain everything quite good
   - if you want to know how to pure your breadboard with the arduino search for: power breadboard with arduino nano
3. get familiar with your arduino by checking out this page: https://www.arduino.cc
   - you can do some experiments there as well.
   - e.g. make the ordered LED blink
4. If you are familiar with your arduino and you know how you can power up the breadboard, how to bring code to your arduino and how the wireing works. I would say you can go on with this "mill project".

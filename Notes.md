Note for everyone:
The Branche "Master-release" is always the copy of the forked Project from romanseidl. Therefore if I want to merge something into the original project I need to do the following:
1. create a branche from "Master-release" for the specific change
2. implement the change in the new branch
3. create a PR from the new branch into "Master-release"
4. If it looks goode create a new PR into ramonseidl Master and my master
5. after PR is merged to ramons master delete the branch (?)
- we will see if ramon or someone will ever merge my PRs. Until then I will keep going mergin int "master-release" and than in my master

The branch "Master" will contain everything i experimnetd with, etc.
Through this I hope that not every hange I do to my master branche will be inserted into Ramons project.

Note for everyone:
The Branche "Master-release" is always the copy of the forked project from romanseidl. Therefore if I want to merge something into the original project I need to do the following:
1. create a branche from "Master-release" for the specific change
2. implement the change in the new branch
3. create a PR from the new branch into "Master" (myBranch)
4. If it looks good create a new PR into ramonseidl Master
5. after PR is merged to ramons master delete the branch (?)
6. once in a while I will need to merge everything from ramon sidl master to my "Master-release"
- we will see if ramon or someone will ever merge my PRs. Until then I will not merge into "master-release" and than in my master, again

The branch "Master" will contain everything I experimneted with, etc.
Through this I hope that not every change I do to my master branche will be inserted into Ramons project.

If somebody know how I can create a PR which caontains only selected files and not everything which was changed. Let me know.

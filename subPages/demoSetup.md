This describes how to set up the demo without the scale

It will looke like this:

- (todo) fritzing picture
- (todo) real picture

1. the project must be inside a IDE (like described in the arduinoWebEditor.md (link needs to be added)
2. set up the components on the breadboard
   1. Arduino
   2. Taster
   3. display
   4. rotary encoder
   5. maybe the On/Off switch needs to be plased here as well
1. the following lines need to be changed (todo: note in the real setup, that some lines might to be changed back)
2. deploy everything on the arduino


Todo: add a demo with scale
